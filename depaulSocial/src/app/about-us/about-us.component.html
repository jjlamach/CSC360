        I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.

        Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

        If you're good at something, never do it for free.

        And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.

        Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
